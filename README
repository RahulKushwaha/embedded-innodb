This is the source of InnoDB 0.1

The long term plan is to convert it incrementally to Zig. Starting with the tests.

So far only lightly tested on Ubuntu 23.10.

Instructions for compiling and installing:

1. cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=(debug|Release) .

2. ninja

3. #ninja install (not tested yet)

4. Enjoy!
